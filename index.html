     <h3>About me </h3>
    <!--This is an intro to me -->
    <p> My name is <strong>Gretel</strong> and I am completing a <em>Bachelor of Secondary Education/ Bachelor of Arts Design Innovation and Technologies</em> at the <a href="https://www.acu.edu.au/">Australian Catholic University.</a></p>
    <p style="color: #000000;">I want to be a teacher because I believe education has the power to inspire, transform, and create opportunities for every student. Teaching allows me to share my passion for learning while helping young people develop the skills, confidence, and curiosity they need to succeed. I am motivated by the idea of making a positive impact, not only on my studentsâ€™ academic growth but also on their personal development, guiding them to reach their full potential and preparing them for life beyond the classroom.</p>
